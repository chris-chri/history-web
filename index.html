            <p>Hey my name is Chris. i am a student at a college.Not telling you where :).  this will be my last project for high seas, i created this for the reason so i can look back and visit my websites easier, oh and for doubloons aswell ( i am shipping this was well). when there is going to be a different Highseas like event i may use these projects as inspirations.
